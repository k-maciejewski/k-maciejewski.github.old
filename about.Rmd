I am a recent graduate from the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University, where I earned my Masters in Biostatistics.

I am currently a biostatistician at the Yale Center for Analytics Sciences.

I hope to use data-driven decisions to improve health care and access to care!

### I am interested in: 
- Data science and big data
- Electronic health records
- Data visualization
- Imaging analysis, such as MRI's
- Machine learning
- Clinical trials
- Best statistical practices
- Study design and analysis methods
- Collaboration across disciplines
- Science education and awareness

### Tools of the trade: 

RStudio, Shiny, SAS, SQL, Tableau, Matlab, loops and arrays ... why do something by hand when a few lines of code can do it just as well!

### Research interests:
- Big data, data management, data visualization
- Mental health
- Maternal health
- Cancer
- Opthalmic care
- Insurance, access to care, attitudes and barriers to care
